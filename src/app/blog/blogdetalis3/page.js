              <p className="digitalmarketing">
                React Native builds on top of React, a popular JavaScript
                library for building user interfaces. It uses JSX (a syntax
                extension for JavaScript) to define components and their
                structure, and leverages React's component-based architecture.
              </p>
              <li className="blogdetalis">Cross-platform development : </li>
              <p className="digitalmarketing">
                One of the main advantages of React Native is its ability to
                create apps that work on multiple platforms using the same
                codebase. This means you can write your app's logic and UI once
                and deploy it on both iOS and Android platforms, saving
                development time and effort.
              </p>
              <li className="blogdetalis">Native-like performance :</li>
              <p className="digitalmarketing">
                React Native uses a bridge that communicates with the native
                components of the underlying platform. This allows React Native
                apps to render UI elements using native views, providing a more
                responsive and performant user experience compared to hybrid
                frameworks like Cordova or Ionic
              </p>
              <li className="blogdetalis">
                Hot reloading and fast iteration :
              </li>
              <p className="digitalmarketing">
                React Native offers hot reloading, which allows you to see the
                changes you make in the code immediately reflected in the
                running app, without the need for a full recompilation or
                restart. This feature significantly speeds up the development
                process and enables faster iteration.
