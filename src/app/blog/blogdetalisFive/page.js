                Component-Based Architecture :
              </li>
              <p className="digitalmarketing">
                React follows a component-based architecture, where UIs are
                broken down into reusable and self-contained components. Each
                component can have its own state and properties, and they can be
                composed together to build complex UI hierarchies.
              </p>
              <li className="blogdetalis">Virtual DOM : </li>
              <p className="digitalmarketing">
                React uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to efficiently
                update and render components. The virtual DOM is a lightweight
                copy of the actual DOM, and React uses it to determine the
                minimal number of updates needed to keep the UI in sync with the
                underlying data. This approach helps improve performance by
                minimizing actual DOM manipulations.
              </p>
              <li className="blogdetalis">JSX Syntax :</li>
              <p className="digitalmarketing">
                React uses JSX (JavaScript XML) syntax, which allows developers
                to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. JSX makes it easier
                to define component structures and their rendering logic. JSX is
                transpiled to regular JavaScript by tools like Babel, enabling
                React code to be compatible with all browsers.
              </p>
              <li className="blogdetalis">Unidirectional Data Flow :</li>
              <p className="digitalmarketing">
                React follows a unidirectional data flow pattern, also known as
                one-way binding. Data flows from parent components to child
                components through properties (props). Child components can
                trigger callbacks to communicate with their parent components.
                This approach helps maintain a predictable and understandable
                data flow in React applications.
