              <p className="digitalmarketing">
                Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which
                makes it well-suited for handling concurrent operations. This
                means that multiple requests can be processed simultaneously
                without blocking the execution of other operations, allowing for
                scalable and efficient applications.
              </p>

              </li>
              <p className="digitalmarketing">
                Node.js operates on a single-threaded event loop architecture.
                While it uses a single thread to handle requests, it employs
                non-blocking I/O operations to maximize efficiency. As a result,
                Node.js can handle a large number of concurrent connections with
                relatively low resource usage.

              <li className="blogdetalis">NPM (Node Package Manager):</li>
              <p className="digitalmarketing">
                Node.js comes with the Node Package Manager, also known as npm,
                which is a powerful package manager and dependency management
                tool. npm allows developers to easily install, manage, and share
                reusable JavaScript modules and libraries, making it a valuable
                resource for the Node.js ecosystem.

              <li className="blogdetalis">Server-side Development :</li>
              <p className="digitalmarketing">
                Node.js is commonly used for server-side development, where it
                enables the creation of web servers and network applications. It
                provides a rich set of built-in modules that facilitate handling
                HTTP requests, file system operations, network protocols, and
                more.
